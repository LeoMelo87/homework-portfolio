    <div class="about">
      <p>
        I work at a media publishing company as a Digital Marketing/Content Exec.
        My daily responsibilities are to take care of the company's main website,
        manage LinkedIn groups, as well as Twitter.
        The company is about to review their website. This is going to be a major
        change, and I wish to contribute better for this change. That is my main
        expectation from this course, as well as the possibility to work on
        a few personal projects of mine.
      </p>
